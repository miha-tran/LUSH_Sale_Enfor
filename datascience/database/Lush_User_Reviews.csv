"  The foundation of my skin care routine!
I have been using this product for three or four months now and I'm in love! I was recommended this product when I went in to the store looking for a new cleanser. I am currently finishing up my second pot! I have combination/sensitive skin that is prone to both acne and eczema breakouts. This cleanser has worked wonders on my skin!"
"Love Love
I absolutely love ""Angels on bare skin"". Highly recommend this. Can't praise this enough. Leaves my skin feeling so soft and clean and love the smell of it too."
"Best cleanser
This is the best cleanser I’ve ever used I’ve used it on and off for over ten years I can see a massive difference in my skin when I’m not using it and as soon as I start using it again my skin feels and looks healthier and glowing I’m definitely going to make an effort to keep buying it it’s pricey but worth it my daughter is getting older now and is needing a skin care routine so I’m going to introduce her to this to start with as the ingredients are all good too it’s what I look for in cosmetics don’t want unnecessary chemicals would definitely recommend angels on bare skin hope they never stop making it"
"Best Wash Ever!
I was recommended this by a Lush Employee for my breakouts. I loved the smell from the minute it was handed to me. It has worked wonders on my skin and kept most of my breakouts gone."
"Saved my Skin
After battling severe acne on and off, almost growing out of it in my 30s, but then having breakouts come back routinely, I had pretty much given up trying anything new. Everything I tried just seemed to irritate my skin more. But I love lush and was out of cleanser while on vacation and needed something, so I tried this and found it was exactly what my skin needed. It’s gentle enough but still powerful enough to keep my skin healthy and avoid most breakouts. I love it. Please never stop making this, Lush!!"
"All Time Fave
I love everything about it, the relaxing scent, the way it leaves my skin feeling clean but not dry. The somewhat plumping effect it has on my skin. It's been my favourite since the 2000's"
"I'm obsessed
I've never had such healthy looking skin I'm obsessed. I have really reactive sensitive skin this leaves my skin still moisturized after I scrub."
"Then I saw my face... Now I'm a believer!
I've been using this for about a month now and I'm honestly stunned. I wasn't expecting anything better than general store cleansers, but this is the real deal. My face is prone to redness, especially after washing, but I noticed this one isn't so irritating to my skin. It gently cleanses the excess oil in ny T-zone without drying out the rest of my face. Throughout the day my face stays naturally glowy, and even lasts great under my makeup too! I'll be coming back for more once my pot is up. (I only use a tiny pinch, btw, a little goes a long way)"
Amazing product! I’ll never look back. My mum received this in a small sample pot in store a couple of months ago and gave it to me to try.
"Best facial cleanser i've used - sensitive skin
As i've gotten older my skin has become VERY sensitive and most facial cleansers give me a bad reaction. Angel's on bare skin is the best thing i've come across! A little pricey but it always keeps my skin feeling great and no adverse reactions!
"
"Can't live my life without this
I feel like a renaissance classy lady when I use this. Feels like earthy mud on a spa day. The smell is my favorite in the world. Has helped with my redness and irritation on face this is heaven in a container"
"Great
Great i love it"
"A staple in my skin care routine
I have never used a facial cleanser that makes my skin feel as soft as this one! Every cleanser I have used completely drys my skin out immediately - not this one! Recommend to anyone! You only need a little - so it goes a long way!"
"This cleanser is magic in each and every way. I can tell it hydrates my skin after use, it smells AMAZING, and it's scrubby enough to deal with the little flakies but not over exfoliate. I'm so glad I could come back to using some of my old favorites! Followed up with an application of Full of Grace Serum and my skin feels amazing!"
"Never using anything else ever again
I've been using this face cleanser for a couple years now. It's incredible! Lightly moisturizing, lightly exfoliating, and smells really good. A little goes a long way too. My face always come out with a lasting glow.
"
"Love This!
I was dedicated to ""Let the Good Times Roll"" but decided to try ""Angels on Bare Skin"" and I'm glad I did! So gentle and refreshing! (As a comparison, I found ""Oaty McOatface"" a little too rough on my sensitive skin.) Angels on Bare Skin is just lovely, and with cool water, leaves my skin calm and clean."
"A ""Best Seller"" for a reason!
I can confidently recommend this product for combination skin types. It has a gentle cleanse that doesn't sap away moisture and encourages natural oils leaving a smooth finish after rinsing. It's by no means a miracle product but it sets out to do exactly as advertised with some additional value depending on the skin type. I'm very happy and I will buy it again... and again ... and probably again!"
"Angles on bare skin cleanser
This product is absolutely wonderful I have acne prone skin. I used to have cysts that useful to last ages but since I started using this product I can’t say that I am not satisfied, Iam on my second pot "
"Amazing! Use for a year and will continue to use
I bought this cleanser about a year ago and have been using it regularly ever since. It is great for my face as it is not at all harsh and I also use it on other parts of my body occasionally and it works amazing for that as well. The container is small but as with most Lush products, you don't need much so it will last you a while. Just take a bit out and mix with water to create almost a kind of paste to run in. I love it and will continue to use this!!"
"The best
This cleanser has been my go to for over five years. It has helped keep my skin hydrated, smooth and clean. I use it every day along side my toner from Lush. If you know about what Lush do I think it is very justified the for the price as the quality of the ingredients are outsourced from wonderful places around the world and equally Lush are trying to ensure this accurately across the board for suppliers, community and their staff. To add, it is a lot cheaper than most brands today. I love this and will continue to use it every day."
"The Holy Grail!!!
I received a sample at one of the LUSH in store events and instantly fell in love with this product. I was hesitant to try anything new on my face as I have spent years dealing with trying to find a balance for my aging, combination skin and the slightest changes usually cause me to break out or become super oily or super dry.
This truly has been a miracle product for me. My face is finally clear, soft, moisturized and I swear my skin looks 10 years younger! The skin on my face has been flawless since I've started my LUSH skincare routine and I give credit to this one!
I've also paired it up with the Breath of Fresh Air toner and Gorgeous moisturizer and the magic has been life changing!!"
"My go too
I got a sample of this and loved it. I have a lot of texture to my skin and it gets oily leaving lots of dead skin cells. This is a gentle way to exfoliate without irritating my skin. The scent is awesome after a little time is starts to not smell as good and that's my only complaint."
"Excellent
I’m so happy with the results, my skin is sensitive and after using this cleanser it looks and feels moisturised."
"Best cleanser!
Honestly one of the best cleaners I have bought from anywhere. I have really dry sensitive skin and it makes it so smooth and refreshed, will for sure be repurchasing! I love the smell too"
"Skin feels soft again
For a few days I ran out of Angels on Bare Skin. What a difference now that I have it again. My skin feels soft again and less dry."
"One of the best things that has ever happened to my face
This cleanser leaves my face feeling so soft and clean. I'm wondering why I ever bothered with harsh cleansers - even the gentle ones aren't this good. I will never use another cleanser. I have sensitive, combination, acne prone skin and Angels on Bare Skin has been amazing. You can tell the difference after just one use. I wasn't really sure how often to use this. Some sources don't recommend more than once a week, while others claim to use it daily or even twice a day with no issues. I initially started using once a day and I didn't have any problems but have started decreasing my use of this to once a week for now, as I am trying to repair my moisture barrier at the moment."
"
Returning to old favorites
I haven't bought any Lush things in a long time because I went through a rough patch, but I still love their products. This cleanser, especially, is one that I have always returned to no matter what other products I've tried. I'm discovering that my skin is no longer combination, but dry dry dry... It's also still freaking sensitive and acne prone though, with the added problem of being oddly flaky."
"
I've used this product for over a decade
I have extremely sensitive dry skin and many soaps, washes, products chemically burn my face. My sister first got me into this product yearsssss ago and I love the sweet, herbal smell and the silky feel of my skin after washing my face. It was my gateway drug into LUSH products."
"The best cleanser for my skin 
This is the best product for my face skin I’m soooo happy I found it! I tried a lot of different products before but none of them helped to make my skin softer and cleaner.  Highly recommend!!!"
"Smoothing & hydrating!
Love this product! Leaves my skin feeling instantly super smooth and silky, helping to even out my skin texture. I have sensitive, combination skin and this product helps remove excess oils from my t-zone whilst also being hydrating and being sensitive skin friendly! I also love the scent - really dreamy and subtle and calming! This product feels like a real treat  it is a very pricey so would love it more if it was more affordable, but I will say that a little goes a long way with this product."
"Heavenly.
I love this. I use it mainly on my face, however, I do use it on my entire body from time to time. It is very nice. Leaves skin feeling soft and hydrated. Smells good, fresh and clean. Florals like roses and lavender to relax and ease the mind."
"A smoothing polish
Once you add ONE OR TWO DROPS of water to create a paste and massage into skin, the skin feels so smooth, supple and cleansed. The best facial cleanser I've EVER tried!"
"For the last couple of years, I’ve had oily/spot-prone skin, and couldn’t get rid of it! I’d tried all the acne creams- azelaic and salicylic acid lotions, you name it! Nothing worked. But then I tried a small amount of this from the sample pot and my skin didn’t get oily at all throughout the day. After a couple of weeks I’d finished the sample pot (you only need a tiny amount- it’s fab) and never broke out in a single spot. I went on to buy the full size tub and after a month and a half of using this, my skin is smooth, not oily and hasn’t had any breakouts! I’m amazed! I don’t usually review, but I felt like I needed to come on and review this, because it’s absolutely worth trying if your skin is oily. If it continues this way, I will never be buying a different face wash again.
Plus- it smells great and is all natural and ethical:)"
"Troubled skin - LOVED IT
OMG my skin feels so calm and smooth with this in my routine. The exfoliant is gentle enough for daily use and it works! I changed up my skincare routine and tried a different cleanser and deeply regretted not having this! 10/10 it smells nice, is calming, and makes my skin look and feel SO GOOD."
"The ONLY product that works for my skin. I usually never give reviews, but this product deserves it. I don't experience much acne at all, but I have a very uneven skin tone as well as a lot of redness from my rosacea. I've tried countless products for 6 years, but nothing other than this product has been able to soothe the redness. My skin looks so even and balanced, I couldn't be happier. I noticed a difference within only 2 uses."
"Great results!
I have combination/acne prone skin. I've tried many products for my skin. After trying this product for the first time using it I completely noticed a difference. Made my skin feel so clean and soft and most of the redness on my face was reduced. It has been a week now and I use this product 2x a day and my acne almost cleared up completely. I haven't had any issues with this product but I definitely make sure I'm applying my moisturizer afterwards! My skin looks great!"
"My skin has never looked so good
I will be using this as my main face cleanser for now on!!! This is the best cleanser out of all of the cleansers!! My acne has never cleared up so fast!"
"best cleanser!!
i was recommended this cleanser by a employee, i bought it immediately after she tested it on my hand. my skin was left feeling clean, smooth & soft! not that dry itchy skin feeling you need to put moisturiser on right away. i’m obsessed with the consistency & scent!! it smells amazing, not harsh on the skin at all. i recommend this product to all my friends & family, they all love it like me :) if you have breakouts on your skin i recommend this product for a cleanser with slight exfoliation!"
"Just buy it! Lol
I can feel the difference when I don't use this on my skin! I get a lot of small little bumps on my hairline and this stuff helps control the oil. It's all cleared up now :) My skin feels so smooth and clean plus is smells REALLY GOOD!"
"Feels like a trip to the spa every time I use it!
I've been using this product for a few years now and I love it! I work as a painter in a furniture shop, so I'm always spraying paint or varnish which always ends up on my face. I have very sensitive skin, and this stuff always makes me feel good and clean after I use it. Sometimes I'll open the jar and just smell it when I need a pick-me-up! I love to use it year-round to keep my skin looking and feeling soft and smooth. I love using this in combination with Vanishing Cream!"
"Best product for my skin
I get some eczema from time to time but lately it got so much worse. I started using this cleanser once a day everyday for about a month now and my eczema is non existent. I still get little flare ups but that is purely stress related and this product does calm the inflammation down a lot and by the next day it is gone.

"Used this cleanser every day for 15 years now
I found Lush about 15 years ago when I was just finishing school and a friend took me to the store in Glasgow. Ever since then Angels is the only product that I use to clean my face every day. I go back and forwards on their other products but Angels is the one I have been buying religiously for 15 years now and I always have a spare pot so I don’t run out. It is the most natural, calming, soothing and at the same time gently cleansing and exfoliating product that I have ever seen. For my skin which is mostly normal and sometimes dry and it works perfectly cleansing away the daily grime, I work in a factory, without drying my skin out. The little bits of almond are hard enough that I can feel it exfoliating and cleaning out my pores but soft enough that I don’t ever feel they’re scratching my skin. I actually feel that it leaves just a tiny bit of oil on my skin so that I never get that harsh squeaky clean feeling that I used to get when I used other cleansers.
I have tried buying the bigger pot once to save some money but I find that it can get mushy if you’re not careful and you put water into the pot, with a smaller pot it doesn’t last as long so you don’t have to worry about it so much. Saying that a small pot lasts me about 3 months because I only use about the amount of two peas and that is enough to massage all over my face.
It has gotten more expensive, I still remember when it used to cost £5 for the smaller pot but this is the product I will continue buying and I really hope Lush never stop making it and never change the formula because I want to keep using it for probably the rest of my life :)

"The best
I been using this product for about 4 years I love it my skin is evenly toned and always balanced not to oily or dry. I love this face scrub."
"My skin has never felt this calm
I got to try a sample of this and I was so surprised at how well it worked for me! My skin gets irritated easily, and has even broken out from simple products that everyone raves about like Cerave. I would've never picked a product with a physical exfoliant, no matter how gentle, because they've always felt so painful on my face, but this feels amazing. It also balances my combination skin so well, and helped clear up my acne. Even my hormonal acne from my cycle isn't as bad. Plus I love the smell. This plus Skin Drink is super soothing."
"I love this one! it's my favorite one!!
I love the lavender!
I love the way that it makes my skin feel it's my favorite face cleanser!"
"The name is really true!
I went to Arizona for a week and went to the pool a lot. This resulted in my skin breaking out and it was horrible. When I went back, this was the first product I used to help my skin. In just two days my skin was getting so much better and my breakouts were getting better. By day 5, my skin cleared up and my friends even complimented about how my complexion looked great."
"Part of my ritual
Love this face scrub! Use this daily or every other day it's the perfect amount of exfoliation yet gentle for my sensitive skin. I recommend this if you're new to lush. This scent of lavender is lovely."
"I suffer from red skin (potentially rosacea) - particularly around the nose/cheeks so I am forever after a product that calms my skin rather than causes it to ""flare"". This is that product. It is soothing, cleansing, but also calming. It feels like your skin has been well cleaned without it feeling scrubbed. I also find my skin stays a more neutral colour during the day now whereas before, any change in temperature, my cheeks and nose redden. I found it a bit fiddly to use at first and I don't love that you end up with little bits of lavender in the sink/bath, but I can live with it just because it does work well..."
"Soft and Smooth
Very gentle. Leaves my skin soft and smooth. Even my boyfriend raved about much he liked it. Love the way my skin feels."
"Luscious. Comforting. Heaven 
22 years ago I loved this product so much that whilst on a gap year I had it sent to New Zealand regularly. It became too much of a luxury to have as a student, and with no Lush stores me I hadn’t bought it since. Until recently, when I was randomly gifted it and not only do I get fuzzy nostalgic feels from my wild and free days when using it, but now also have truly grateful, soft and spoilt skin. What a product. Thank you Lush and the angels."
"Brilliant product!
I have been using this cleanser for a few years now and I love it, makes your skin feel so fresh, smooth and clean."
"Tiny Angels cleaning my face
Angels on Bareskin is my absolute go to, for face cleansers. This stuff is the best. I once went on vacation to Scotland, ran out of it and luckily found a Lush store and bought more while I was there! This has been my go to for 8 years and I tell everyone I know about it. Fantastic product, smells wonderful, makes my skin feel fantastic and I love it."
"Tiny angels making my face feel and look good
I absolutely love Angela on Bareskin. This is my go to cleanser and has been for about 8 years. I was vacationing in Scotland and was running out and I saw a Lush store and popped in to buy more. This stuff smells good, feels good and makes my skin look amazing. I tell everyone I know to try it because it's that good!
"
"This is one of the best face scrubs I've used.
I got this as a sample from my last lush purchase. I love it !! My skin is super oily and by the end of the day my skin doesn't feel great from the oil build up so I like to exfoliate a lot. This is the only product I've used that's not harsh on my face and doesn't break me out. If anything it helps !!"
"Angelic
Was given this as a sample alongside Happy Skin (highly recommend to use together!) This is less harsh exfoliant than happy skin but i use this between my weekly use of happy skin and it smooths my skin, clears the oil and helps with spots! The only issue I have with the product is its quite bitty, you need to scoop a small bit then emulse in the water and can be quite hard to do this and i dont really like the texture (but this is personal preference) other than this i have no complaints!
"
"LOVE!
I use this cleaner on my face every other day in the shower. I love the gentle exfoliating feeling and love the soothing smell. It makes my maturing skin feel soft and clean."
"The best skincare product
Been using it for years, softens soothes hydrates the skin, got rid of my rosacea, keeps my skin clear! love it!"
"My go to skin product
I love this, have used for years and makes my oily skin less shiny and red."
"Stop giving me test pots!!!
I was passing through Victoria and thought I would stock up on my usuals. At the till I mentioned testers get me in trouble as I fall in love with too many things... And there it was, a tempting little pot of something I actually was debating trying.
You've done it again Lush! Another item I have fallen in love with, it smells divine, it gently exfoliates, a little goes a long way, and best of all, my skin feels so good! So much so, I barely needed any moisturizer after a shower.
Yet another item to add to my evening shower routine. Boo to you all for winning me over again! I am a slave to another great product!"
"Staple product
I have been using this product for years, since they first came out with it I think, and it's been tried and true! I have sensitive combination skin and this leaves my skin feeling clean and soft! I love the gentle exfoliation as well."
"My Go-To Cleanser
I switched from Rodan & Fields, which is twice the price and does not last as long, not to mention that it left my skin feeling a bit dry.
I use this every night, and I love how it cleanses my skin without leaving it feeling dry."
"INLOVE
I’ve been using this face cleanser for years.

I love this product so much! It’s done wonders for my face & I hope it’s never discontinued. Definitely keep this in the fridge for refreshment."
"Makes my skin glow
I absolutely love this stuff. It's worth the money and a little goes a long way.
No other product I've ever used has made my skin so clear, healthy and glowy like this. It also makes my skin so soft. I've been using it for a few years now and I'll continue to do so!"
"Repeat Purchaser
I use this on my face for my more mature, drier skin, and it works wonders. Leaves face clean, feeling moisturized and soft without feeling greasy or heavy."
"Amazing make-up remover
I have to say, I've been wearing make-up since the 80's (yes I'm now old) and I have to say, I have not found a product that takes off make-up so easily and comes out of face washers so easily. Leaves my skins so soft and smooth and the smell of Lavender can get a little strong in the beginning, but honestly this product is beautiful. I'm purchasing again. PS I'm in my very very early 50's"
"YES YES YES!
I have sensitive acne-prone combination skin, and it is really challenging to find a product that cleans and exfoliates without completely irritating my skin, BUT I FOUND IT! The texture is definitely different and a little strange at first, but trust me when I tell you that it is worth it. It is the softest exfoliant I have ever used, but it still gets the job done just as well leaving my skin soft and happy! Calming, cleansing, and hydrating all at the same time!"
"Gentle scrub
This cleanser offers a gentle scrub that smakes my skin feel super smooth. It has helped ""scrub out"" my irritated dead skin cells and has make my skin feel plumped and hydrated. A little goes a long way so my jar will last a very long time!"
"Holy grail for my skin
This is the only thing that can tame my skin. My face is oily with dry patches and is very red and sensitive. Every cleanser I've used either broke me out or made my skin dry and irritated. This balances my skin and I can see immediate results. I also use it on my body because it makes ur skin smooth and very soft to the touch, I go through a tub of this in less than 2 months I love it so much and the smell is literally addicting. Kinda pricey but I think it's worth it"
"I love this product!
I bought this today because I was looking for a product that soothes my combined skin (slightly oily t-zone, the rest of my skin is more sensitive).
After very good advice of a staff member of the Amsterdam Kalverstraat Lush (I am sorry kind sir, i didnt get your name!) I decided on this product. I am happy to say my face feels so good after using this! No tightness of the skin, no flaky skin. The smell is amazing too.
I love the lavender flowers in it, they give it an extra kind of scrub. I also love the texture and smell of the overal product.
Would definitely buy this again!"
"Love it’
Such a gentle exfoliator and cleanser all in one, smells divine and really does the job! Was recommended this from a staff
Member here at lush.com and that staff member really does know her stuff. Thank you Lush please never discontinue’"
