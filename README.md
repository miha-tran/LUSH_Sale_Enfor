<h2><strong>Trend in Recycling and Packaging Garbage overtime: Sustainability trend monitoring </strong></h2>

<h3>As sustainability becomes more important to governments and societies, stakeholders are recognizing that companies embracing sustainable practices hold greater future value. Consumers are becoming increasingly conscious of their impact on the environment and are demanding more sustainable products and services. Moving forward, both inside and outside stakeholders will have a big say in ensuring companies stick to their sustainability goals and follow through with actions. So we suggest that sustainability continues to be a key feature defining Lush.</h3>
